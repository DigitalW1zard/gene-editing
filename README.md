# gene-editing
This code assumes you have Biopython installed (pip install biopython) for handling DNA sequences and performing CRISPR-Cas9 editing. In practice, genetic engineering programs can involve more complex manipulations, such as gene synthesis, pathway engineering, and protein engineering. Additionally, considerations like off-target effects, efficiency, and specificity need to be addressed in real-world applications.
